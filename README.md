# Movies Record Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This project is part of the Data Visualization Track, where we explore intriguing questions about the movie industry using data. Have you ever wondered how popular different movie genres are around the world? Do you question whether the popularity of movies and genres changes over time? How much does it cost to make movies, and are they a profitable business? This project provides answers to these questions and more!

Through interactive data visualizations, we uncover trends in movie genres by country and year, analyze revenue patterns, and showcase the top and bottom revenue-generating movies in history. The project leverages Python and JavaScript with libraries like Plotly to create engaging visuals, including choropleth maps, scatter plots, and bar diagrams.

## Project Structure

The project is hosted on a webpage with five main sections:
1. **Introduction** - Provides an overview of the project.
2. **Popularity by Country** - Displays which movie genres were popular in different countries using choropleth maps.
3. **Genre Popularity by Year** - Shows popular genres over different years through scatter plots and bar charts.
4. **Overall Revenue Trends** - Visualizes the total revenue generated by movies over time.
5. **Top and Bottom Revenue Movies** - Lists the top 30 and bottom 30 revenue-generating movies.

Each section allows users to interact with the visualizations via dropdown menus, enabling them to filter data by country, genre, and year for a detailed exploration.

## How to Use the Project

1. **Navigate the Webpage** - Use the navigation bar to explore the different sections.
2. **Interact with Visualizations** - Dropdown menus on each page allow you to filter data by country, genre, or year, and visualizations will update accordingly.
3. **Explore the Trends** - Uncover patterns in genre popularity, movie revenue, and other trends by interacting with the data.

## Ethical Considerations

In conducting this project, we ensured ethical handling of data by:
- Cleaning the data to remove inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant entries (e.g., movies with null values).
- Respecting the privacy and integrity of data sourced from TMDB and IMDb, following their usage policies.
- Ensuring accurate representation of the data in visualizations, avoiding any manipulative or misleading practices.

## Data Sources

- **TMDB API**: Primary data source for movie records.
- **IMDb Codes**: Used for further data cleaning and enrichment.
